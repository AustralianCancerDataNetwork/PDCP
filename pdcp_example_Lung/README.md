Example
=================

This folder contains an example used to create and process a cohort of five patients collected from a public lung cancer dataset: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NSCLC-Radiomics

The dataset was originally added into an Orthanc server. 


The patientImagingCR class that extends patientImaging was used in this example.

This class can be used for preparing autocontouring tasks.

Due to size, only few outputs were kept before uploading this example to GitHub.
