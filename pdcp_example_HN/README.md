Example
=================

This folder contains an example used to create and process a cohort of five patients collected from a public head and neck cancer dataset: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Head-Neck-PET-CT

The dataset was originally added into an Orthanc server. 


The __patientImagingCRD__ was used in this example. This class assumes that there are no RTPLANs in the study, and all the RTDOSEs belong to the study.


Three modalities were targeted: 

- CT
- RTSTRUCT
- RTDOSE


Due to size, only few outputs were kept before uploading this example to GitHub.
